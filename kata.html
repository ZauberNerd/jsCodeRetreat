        <p>
          Probably the most commonly known kata in the coding dojo and retreat 'scene'.
          We choose this one to start running on as big as possible known ground.

          <blockquote>
            The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the
            British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
            The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
            initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by
            creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
          </blockquote>

          <a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why">
          <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why One Kata For All Locations?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://gdcr.coderetreat.org">global day of code retreat</a> was nearing and
          since we really liked the idea and wanted to join we started discussing
          if we shouldn't do something like that just for us web developers. So we can learn
          more and just practice only on JavaScript ... and from there it started.
          Out of a simple local event this evolved, let's see what it becomes.
          <br>
          <a href="http://twitter.com/mrupilo">Martin</a> and
          <a href="http://twitter.com/wolframkriesing">me </a> we sat together and discussed what
          we think could be a cool format for this code retreat and what we think could and should
          be done to enhance the experience and get even more out of it for us web developer.
          <br>
          After some forth and back we thought of the following:
          <ol>
            <li>A pure JavaScript Code Retreat</li>
            <li>All locations working on the same code (a Kata we have to find together before)</li>
            <li>All locations do the same exercises on that code</li>
            <li>Joined retrospective after every session across all locations (that will be the fun part I guess)</li>
          </ol>
          Maybe sounds strange in the beginning but we thought that <i>limiting the
          differences</i> will allow us to have something that we can talk about across
          all locations.
          If every location does the same things and uses the same technology we
          can really discuss about the same thing afterwards and our hangout/video
          stream after every session will be interesting for everyone across all locations.
          And there won't be explanations needed about what kata it was, the difference
          in programming languages, etc. This allows us to dive really deep into specific
          problems and makes it easy for everyone to be on the same page.
          And therefore I would suggest we name the event "The Unified JavaScript Code Retreat".
